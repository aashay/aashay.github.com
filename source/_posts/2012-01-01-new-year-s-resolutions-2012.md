summary: Once again I'm posting my New Year's Resolutions somewhere public (my blog) so that I'm more likely to follow them. My resolutions this year are the same as last year's with one noteable exception.

_Once again I'm posting my New Year's Resolutions somewhere public (my blog) so that I'm more likely to follow them. My resolutions this year are the same as last year's with one noteable exception._
<!-- more -->

Last year I made some [pretty basic resolutions](http://aashay.com/Kaizen/Resolutions/2010/09/29/new-year-s-resolutions-2011.html). I made great progress on some and not-so-great progress on others, but this year there's very little different I want to do, with one noteable exception.

To recap:

* Get Healthy (work out)
* Keep better tabs on my finances
* Write (I fail at this one every year)
* Kaizen (general self-improvement)

If there's one thing I'd like to add to the list:

* Balance.  

I've fallen into the habit of spending a lot of time working on one subset of skills and talents that I tend to let others fall behind.  Specifically, I'd like to tap back into my creative side (vis a vis music) while I continue to improve my hacking chops.  Ideally, this means taking both sides to an extreme. 

I'd like to write at least _one_ song this year and start at least _one_ open-source project (hopefully something that develops as a result of my work with [AnonyMou.se](http://anonymou.se))
