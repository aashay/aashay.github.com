I've been blogging on and off on this site for many years, and the site itself has gone through several iterations.  Even after a long hiatus, however, I'd still remember to come back and post my [New Year's](http://aashay.com/blog/2010/09/29/new-year-s-resolutions-2011/) [Resolutions](http://aashay.com/blog/2012/01/01/new-year-s-resolutions-2012/).

Astute readers of this site (all two of you) will have noticed that I never posted anything in 2013.  The reason behind this was simple:  I wanted 2013 to be a different year.

2013 was all about serendipity.  I decide to simply "go with the flow" and see where life took me.  It certainly wasn't all roses, but everything that happened made my life happier in the end.

2014 is going to be the exact opposite.  I have one resolution, and while it sounds simple, it's going to be an incredible challenge:  Be In Control.

This year, I intend to be in full control of my life situation at all times.  This will mean making all kinds of tough decisions, including cutting out people, places, and things that aren't helping me grow as a person.  More importantly, being in control means leaving nothing to chance and not letting others determine my future for me.

I know it all sounds a little self-helpy, but given the various events of 2013, it's clearly the number one thing I need to keep in mind.
