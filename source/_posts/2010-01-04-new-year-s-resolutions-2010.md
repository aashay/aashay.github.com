<div id="_mcePaste">Of my New Year's Resolutions from 2009, I managed to actually accomplish all but 2 (I never did get to contribute to an open-source project, and I definitely haven't written anything new).   I figure I might as well tell you the plan for this year:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">
<ul>
	<li>Save money.  Lots of it.</li>
	<li>"Level up" in mastery of my instruments (this means noticeable improvements)</li>
	<li>Overcome this epic writer's block and write something</li>
	<li>Continue to exercise and try and increase my <a href="http://www.matchmakertennis.com/public/ntrp.html" target="_blank">NTRP rating</a> by summer</li>
	<li>Focus on projects that matter, including one major to-be-determined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal" target="_blank">Big Hairy Audacious Goal </a></li>
	<li>Focus on the people that matter</li>
	<li>Stimulate my career path</li>
</ul>
</div>
Let's hear your resolutions for this year!
