title: New Year's Resolutions 2011
summary: I’ve made it a tradition to post my New Year's Resolutions here on my blog.  The idea is that if they’re posted somewhere public, I’ll be more likely to follow them.  This year, I’m going to do a recap of last year’s resolutions and see which ones I’ve kept and which ones I’ve broken.

I didn’t do so bad this year!  Let’s take a look at my New Year’s resolutions from 2010 and see how I managed to do:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
	<li>Save money.  Lots of it. - <em>I think I did pretty well here.</em></li>
	<li>"Level up" in mastery of my instruments (this means noticeable improvements) <em>- This one is hard to judge by myself, but my bandmates seem pretty happy with my skill.</em></li>
	<li>Overcome this epic writer's block and write something - <em>Epic fail.</em></li>
	<li>Continue to exercise and try and increase my <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.matchmakertennis.com/public/ntrp.html">NTRP rating</a></span> by summer - <em>Although I did manage to increase my NTRP rating, I’ve fallen off the tennis boat in favor for more traditional forms of exercise.</em></li>
	<li>Focus on projects that matter, including one major to-be-determined <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal">Big Hairy Audacious Goal</a></span> - <em>I did pretty well last year but this coming year is the real determining year.</em></li>
	<li>Focus on the people that matter - <em>A perpetual goal, I’d say I did just fine</em></li>
	<li>Stimulate my career path - <em>Yep.</em></li>
</ul>
So of all the resolutions, I managed to only break the writing one.  Oddly enough I did the same thing in 2009.

Now let’s take a look at my resolutions for 2011.
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
	<li><strong>Get healthy. </strong> I’ve recently discovered that I might not be in the most perfect state of health, so this year my focus is to drastically change my diet and exercise habits.  Fortunately I got a head start a few weeks ago on this one so I don’t think this’ll be very hard to maintain.</li>
	<li><strong>Continue saving money. </strong> I didn’t do so bad last year but this year I’m going to be taking even more aggressive steps to save, including making some smart investments.</li>
	<li><strong>Write damnit! </strong> I know I tell everyone I’m going to do this every year, but this year I mean it.  I’ve recently started journaling and hopefully I’ll post some of my better essays on this blog.  I’m also considering starting up a secondary “nerd” blog to write about my misadventures in hacking on my personal projects, but I’m still working on the logistics (i.e. whether or not they’ll be posted here).</li>
	<li><strong>Kaizen</strong> aka Continual self-improvement.  I need to improve any existing talents, including (but not limited to) music and hacking.  The latter especially will help with career moves.</li>
	<li><strong>Learn something new. </strong>I’d like to add another skill to my plate this year, and I’m thinking it might have to do with cooking.  Fortunately I’ve got a wonderful partner-in-crime for this particular endeavor, and learning to cook will help me out with resolution 1 as well.</li>
</ul>
So, there you have it.  Now let’s hear your resolutions!
