title: New Year's Resolutions 2009
summary: Normally I post long-form essays here on my site.  However, I figured if I exposed my New Year's Resolutions somewhere public, I might be more prone to follow them.

_Normally I post long-form essays here on my site.  However, I figured if I exposed my New Year's Resolutions somewhere public, I might be more prone to follow them._

I wrote down my New Year's resolutions in one of my <a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> notebooks, but I figure I'd share them with you all.  I'd say they're pretty realistic and hopefully I won't have problems sticking to 'em.  So, without further ado:
<ul>
	<li>Practice guitar/bass for a total of 5 hours a week, minimum</li>
	<li>Compose music again</li>
	<li>Write more (both blog essays and hopefully restart the fiction work too)</li>
	<li>Talk to strangers more (and meet more people in SF)</li>
	<li>Exercise (I'm sure I'll be more motivated when my <a href="http://www.fitbit.com" target="_blank">FitBit</a> arrives)</li>
	<li>Contribute to an open-source project</li>
	<li>Get a raise/promotion at (or before) my 1-year anniversary at my company</li>
</ul>
What were your New Year's resolutions?  Post some in the comments section (or in the Notes comments if you're reading this via Facebook)!
