<h2 id="title:mongooseisapain.">title: Mongoose is a pain.</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a project and I&#8217;m using the <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a> object modeling tool to communicate with <a href="http://mongodb.com">MongoDB</a>.  </p>

<p>I have to say, while it certainly has its benefits, it&#8217;s kind of a pain in the ass, especially for the following reasons:
1. Terribly organized documentation.  Go take a look at the website and the API ref if you don&#8217;t believe me.
2. General community inertia.  I&#8217;ve seen at least half a dozen Google Group messages that reference errors I&#8217;m having with no reasonable responses. 
3. Useless error messages like this:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/lib/node/.npm/mongoose/1.1.5/package/lib/mongoose/types/array.js:62
 var cast = this._schema.caster.prototype.cast
                                 ^

<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure what this is trying to tell me, but I think </p>
